# mRNN
mRNN is a package for making predictions on transcripts using recurrent neural networks


# TODO
1) Test the batch predict and prepare batches pipeline
    -Modify batch_predict to be a generator

2) Finish filling out the main train/test package
    

3) Fill out the post-processing/evaluation metrics
    -Shuffling
    -Pointwise
    -Overtime -- try modifying the model and loading weights but return - sequences = true, just need to apply the LR layer to each output

4) Implement unit tests

5) Implement some examples (including our own datasets and a mouse dataset)

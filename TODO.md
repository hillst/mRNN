    - modify batch_predict to be a generator

2) Finish filling out the main train/test package

3) Fill out the post-processing/evaluation metrics
    - Shuffling
    - Pointwise
    - Overtime -- try modifying the model and loading weights but return - sequences = true, just need to apply the LR layer to each output
